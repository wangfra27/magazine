            <p>The automotive industry has propelled itself into the national spotlight in recent years, as the development of electric vehicles (EVs) has come closer and closer to public, widespread release. <a href="https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2022/page/1">BloombergNEF</a> noted in their Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 that over half of all passenger vehicles sold in the US by 2030 will be electric vehicles. This transition has been expedited due to the Biden administration's new spending for tackling climate change, authorizing <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/president-biden-us-department-transportation-releases-toolkit-help-rural-communities">$7.5 billion</a> for the installation of EV charging stations across the US. Though this growth is a great step for building a greener earth, it has established EVs as a whole new, publicly available commodity that engineers around the world will have to maintain security for. </p>
            <p>A plethora of scares have popped up around the world in recent times regarding EV security, concerning many in the cybersecurity industry about a widespread release. Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teen-security-researcher-describes-how-he-hacked-into-25-teslas-2022-1">19 year old from Germany</a> was able to exploit over 25 Teslas around the world from the comfort of his own home. Similar exploits occurred regarding charging stations in both <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-61006816">Britain</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/02/28/hacked-electric-car-charging-stations-russia-displays-putin-dckhead-glory-to-ukraine/">Russia</a>, with hackers remotely taking over charging stations and ports. While all events thus far have been pretty small, the attacks have the potential to get much worse. </p>
            <p>The incidents in Britain and Russia have demonstrated that many attackers have found the easiest attack vector that EVs open up to be the charging stations. Many charging stations use the <a href="https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-201/">Open Charge Point Protocol</a> (OCPP) to communicate with the central management system. This system provides communications such as battery type, battery status, and power type as intended, but fails to encrypt data and communications, making it extremely risky, especially as charging stations are more likely to be run remotely, and therefore connected to the Internet of Things. This gives attackers easy and remote access to a plethora of cars that literally line up to come to the attacker. If the attacker is willing to make a physical trip, they can access the charging stations’ USB ports, which could potentially give attackers access to logs and data from the charging stations, allowing them to access information on users, such as ID numbers that could lead to larger data leaks. </p>
            <p>The infrastructure of the vehicle itself is also more likely to be at risk. Since many EVs are newly designed and built, many are equipped with the most modern advancements in order to maximize their performance and abilities. As a result, many EVs have a wide attack surface from their many connections to the IoT. Modern cars regularly connect to wifi, cellular services, other vehicles, and the infrastructure around them. All of these end up as possible entries for malicious attacks.</p>
            <p>The risks generated by EVs have begun to draw nationwide attention. In addition to the many private sector workers who are working to secure the cars of the companies they work for. government agencies have begun meeting with private sector researchers to discuss rules and regulations. The Office of the National Cyber Director(ONCD) was established under the Biden administration with the goal of advising the President of the United States in regards to matters of cybersecurity. It has recently taken special notice of EV security risks, hosting <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/25/readout-of-cybersecurity-executive-forum-on-electric-vehicles-and-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-hosted-by-the-office-of-the-national-cyber-director/">forums</a> with both automakers and EV charging manufacturers to discuss potential cyber risks. The White House noted that participants have agreed to work together to assess the current state of cybersecurity standards and research and development to identify opportunities for harmonization and future work. </p>
            <p>All of these efforts by the government are a great first step, pushing current cybersecurity in the right direction, but is it enough?</p>
            <p>In order to truly achieve a safe and sustainable cybersecurity practice for EVs, there are still many more steps that need to be taken. While the ONCD has worked with private sector employees to assess and identify cybersecurity risks, all parties have yet to announce any specific actions.</p>
            <p>It is imperative that the public and private sectors work together to develop a a new more secure protocol for the EV charging infrastructure. While the OCPP works well to achieve its goal of connectivity, it is not written with security in mind. A new remade protocol should be developed by engineers from the public sector in conjunction with the private sector specifically with security in mind.</p>
            <p>In addition, the executive forums created by the OCPP should work to develop new regulations and requirements for EVs and their charging stations, to ensure that automotive companies don't skimp on their security practices. Just like the existing safety and environmental regulations in place for automotives, developing and enforcing new regulations for cybersecurity would help to keep companies from slacking off and maintain national security. While these standards are harder both to test and enforce than their environmental counterparts, it is of paramount importance that they be developed.</p>
            <p>Finally, the step that would be most beneficial for developing a secure world of EVs would be a collaboration of corporations that made the sharing of ideas more commonplace. In recent years, technological advancements have been slowed by corporate secrecy. In the cybersecurity industry, this secrecy can be detrimental, giving hackers weaker targets for attack and hurting the public as a whole. A level of trust needs to be built between companies that allows them to share their findings in regards to security without having to worry about competition. The true enemy is the looming threat of attackers who work to threaten the lives and day to day operations of the everyday American.</p>
            <p>Even if many of these solutions are already in the works, the sluggishness of the government's actions in comparison to the industrious chug of the corporate machine means that many of these actions may come about too late. Cyber concerns are in the background of many people's minds, and won't move to the forefront until after an attack has occurred. It is the obligation of cybersecurity experts all around the country to keep these concerns in the background to minimize public distrust and concern. </p>
