            <p>The automotive industry has propelled itself into the national spotlight in recent years, as the development of electric vehicles (EVs) has come closer and closer to public, widespread release. <a href="https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2022/page/1">BloombergNEF</a> noted in their Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 that over half of all passenger vehicles sold in the US will be electric vehicles. This transition has been expedited due to the Biden administration’s new spending for tackling climate change, authorizing <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/president-biden-us-department-transportation-releases-toolkit-help-rural-communities">$7.5 billion</a> for the installation of EV charging stations across the US. Though this growth is a great step for building a greener earth, it has generated a whole new, publicly available commodity that engineers around the world will have to maintain security for. </p>
            <p>A plethora of scares have popped up around the world in recent times regarding EV security, concerning many in the cybersecurity industry about a widespread release. Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teen-security-researcher-describes-how-he-hacked-into-25-teslas-2022-1">19 year old from Germany</a> was able to remotely access over 25 Teslas around the world from the comfort of his own home. Similar exploits occurred regarding charging stations in both <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-61006816">Britain</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/02/28/hacked-electric-car-charging-stations-russia-displays-putin-dckhead-glory-to-ukraine/">Germany</a>, with hackers taking over screens for propaganda purposes. While all events thus far have been pretty small, experts are warning that the attacks can get much worse. </p>
            <p>The biggest attack vector that EVs open up are through the charging stations. Many charging stations use the <a href="https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-201/">Open Charge Point Protocol</a> (OCPP) to communicate with the central management system. This system does its job well, but fails to encrypt data and communications, making it extremely risky, especially as charging stations are more and more likely to be connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). Many charging stations also have USB ports, which could potentially give attackers access to logs and data from the charging stations, allowing them to access information on users, such as ID numbers that could lead to larger data leaks.</p>
            <p>The infrastructure of the vehicle itself is also more likely to be at risk. Since many EVs are newly designed and built, many are equipped with the most modern advancements in order to maximize its performance and abilities. As a result, many EVs have a wide attack surface from their many connections to the IoT. Modern cars regularly connect wifi, cellular services, other vehicles, and the infrastructure around them. All of these end up as possible entries for malicious attacks.</p>
            <p>That's not to say no one is doing anything about the growing cyber threats. In addition to the many private sector workers who are working to secure the cars of the companies they work for. government agencies have begun meeting with private sector researchers to discuss rules and regulations. The Office of the National Cyber Director(ONCD) was established under the Biden administration with the goal of advising the President of the United States in regards to matters of cybersecurity. It has recently taken special notice of EV security risks, hosting <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/25/readout-of-cybersecurity-executive-forum-on-electric-vehicles-and-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-hosted-by-the-office-of-the-national-cyber-director/">forums</a> with both automakers and EV charging manufacturers to discuss potential cyber risks. The White House noted that participants have agreed to work together to assess the current state of cybersecurity standards and research and development to identify opportunities for harmonization and future work.</p>
            <p>All of these efforts by the government are a great first step, pushing current cybersecurity in the right direction, but is it enough?</p>
            <p>In order to truly achieve a safe and sustainable cybersecurity practice for EVs, there are still many more steps that need to be taken. While the ONCD has worked with private sector employees to assess and identify cybersecurity risks, all parties have notably stayed away from any specific actions.</p>
            <p>It is imperative that the public and private sectors work together to develop a cybersecurity standard for the EV charging infrastructure. While the OCPP works well to achieve its goal of connectivity, it is not written with security in mind. A new remade protocol should be developed by engineers from the public sector in conjunction with the private sector specifically with security in mind.</p>
            <p>In addition, the executive forums created by the OCPP should work to develop new regulations and requirements for EVs and their charging stations, to ensure that automotive companies don't skimp on their security practices. Just like the existing safety and environmental regulations in place for automotives, developing and enforcing new regulations for cybersecurity would help to keep companies from slacking off and maintain national security. While these standards are harder both to test and enforce than their environmental counterparts, it is of paramount importance that they be developed.</p>
            <p>Finally, the step that would be most beneficial for developing a secure world of EVs would be a collaboration of corporations that made the sharing of ideas more commonplace. In recent years, technological advancements can be slowed by corporate secrecy. In the cybersecurity industry, this secrecy can be detrimental, giving hackers weaker targets for attack and hurting the public as a whole. A level of trust needs to be built between companies that allows them to share their findings in regards to security without having to worry about competition. The true enemy is the looming threat of attackers who work to threaten the lives and day to day operations of the everyday American.</p>
            <p>Even if many of these solutions are already in the works, the sluggishness of the government's actions in comparison to the industrious chug of the corporate machine means that many of these actions may come about too late. Cyber concerns are in the background of many people's minds, and won't move to the forefront until after an attack has occurred. Rapid initiative is essential to the security of America, especially with the upcoming introduction of EVs.</p>
